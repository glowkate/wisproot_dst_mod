I'm making a mod for Don't Starve Together. First time modding and I hope it goes well.

Hunger: 200
Health: 150
Sanity: 150

Speach guide:
Speeks in short phrases, the less words the better. Will use complex words. Comes off as very self-confident and cocky, but is terrified of hurting the ones he loves.

Scared of shadow creatures, darkness, beardlings, beardlords, and anything lunar.
Dislikes the texture of liquid, sticky, and slimy foods, cave spiders, batalisks, and tentacles.
Likes bunnys, carrots, bunnymen, beefalo, volt goats, totally normal trees, and reanimated skeletons of any sort.
Cocky around surface spiders, hounds, frogs, bees, trees, pigs, and clockworks.
Interested in merms, humans, wx-78, surface bosses, aquatic items structures and mobs, and birds of all sorts.
Has no quams about eating meat but will always acknowledge that he is doing so.

Respects all the other survivors.
